## Synopsis

This is a single-page app that helps you use the <em><acr title="North American Trade Organization">NATO</acr> phonetic alphabet</em>.

## Motivation

I need a phonetic alphabet maybe once every three months. This will be nice to have when I'm on the phone with some billing department.
